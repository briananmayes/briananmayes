# Welcome to `beemayesdev` 👋

## Bio - Who is beemayesdev? 
My name is Briana, but you can call me Bee 🐝. I am a 🌈 queer software developer from 📍 Houston, TX. My pronouns are they/them/boss, so please use them accordingly! I am a full-stack developer at heart, but I am currently focusing on mastering front-end technologies to develop creative and dynamic UIs. I enjoy creating REST APIs and working with relational databases. I also like to learn about and tinker with AI/ML, Data Analytics, and Game Development! Stay tuned for more projects 😄!
